## <img src="https://i.ibb.co/nRxHpxT/medicine.png" width="45px" /> Introduction

> This Python bot is designed to gather interactions data from the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (`DGIdb`) and utilizes the `sydney-py` library to obtain more detailed information about specific interactions.


## <img src="https://i.ibb.co/LPp8y3N/genes.png" width="45px" /> Features

- [x] **Interaction with Sydney**
  - Utilizes the Sydney module to obtain detailed and contextually informative responses on drug-gene interactions.

- [x] **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
  - Provides an intuitive command-line interface, facilitating script interaction.

- [x] **Graphical Gene Interactions Chart**
  - Generates a bar chart of gene interactions concerning a user-selected gene, offering a visual representation of information.

- [x] **Elegant Response in PyQt5 Box**
  - Displays responses in a graphical box created with PyQt5, providing a visually pleasing and intuitive user experience.

- [x] **Rich Box Visualization**
  - Presents drug-gene interactions in visually formatted Rich boxes.

- [x] **Interaction Details**
  - Displays important interaction details, including scores, interaction types, gene names, and more.

- [x] **Minimum Requirements**
  - Requires Python 3.9 - 3.11 as the execution environment.
  - External dependencies, including rich, sydney, PyQt5, requests, and matplotlib, can be easily installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
