## Introduction

> This Python bot is designed to gather interactions data from the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (`DGIdb`) and utilizes the `sydney-py` library to obtain more detailed information about specific interactions.


## Features

- [x] **Interaction with Sydney**
  - Utilizes the Sydney module to obtain detailed and contextually informative responses on drug-gene interactions.

- [x] **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
  - Provides an intuitive command-line interface, facilitating script interaction.

- [x] **Graphical Gene Interactions Chart**
  - Generates a bar chart of gene interactions concerning a user-selected gene, offering a visual representation of information.

- [x] **Elegant Response in PyQt5 Box**
  - Displays responses in a graphical box created with PyQt5, providing a visually pleasing and intuitive user experience.

- [x] **Rich Box Visualization**
  - Presents drug-gene interactions in visually formatted Rich boxes.

- [x] **Interaction Details**
  - Displays important interaction details, including scores, interaction types, gene names, and more.

- [x] **Minimum Requirements**
  - Requires Python 3.9 - 3.11 as the execution environment.
  - External dependencies, including rich, sydney, PyQt5, requests, and matplotlib, can be easily installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- [x] **Simple Usage Instructions**
  - Follow the provided instructions to install dependencies and run the script, making application usage straightforward and immediate.

- [x] **Author Information**
  - Provides a section dedicated to the project authors.

- [x] **Open Source License (MIT)**

> It is recommended that the Python version be between 3.9.X~3.10.X, version 3.10-3.11 is perfect

#### 1. Clone repo

```bash
https://github.com/BlackDicky/DrugGeneExplorer.git
```

## Dependencies
- requests
- io
- asyncio
- sydney
- rich

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Script

- **Once all the steps are completed, you can launch the script by using the command `python3 DrugGeneExplorer.py`**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `In progress of finalizing everything; it should be ready within a few days.`
