# DrugGeneExplorer
This Python script is designed to provide detailed information on interactions between drugs and genes using the Sydney module for natural language processing and the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) API. Users can input the names of three drugs separated by commas and receive information on the interactions with the corresponding genes.
